# K-nearest Neighbors

## This supervised ML algorithm can be used for both regression and classification:

- Regression:

  - Predict continuous numerical value based on averages of k-nearest neighbors
  - Examples:
    - Predicting House Prices: Estimating the value of a house based on the prices of nearby houses.
    - Stock Price Prediction: Predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

- Classifiation (more common use-case):
  - Assign Label based on the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors
  - Examples:
    - Image Classification: Identifying objects or patterns within images.
    - Medical Diagnosis: Predicting disease classes based on patient data.
